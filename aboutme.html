      <p>In my free time, I go longboarding. I actually started doing this at the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester
        and
        it has been one thing that has kept me calm throughout all this craziness.</p>
      <img id="long-img" src="img/lonboard.jpg" alt="longboarding">
      <p>After a nice relaxing longboarding session, I come back to my computer sceen and lose money in cryptocurrency
        markets.</p>

      <h4>Anime</h4>
      <p>I am a big anime fan. Currently my favorite anime is <strong>Hunter X Hunter</strong></p>
      <p>I believe that anime is a masterpiece and I hope it is finished before I take my last breath.</p>

      <h4>Music</h4>
      <p>My music consists of alot of rap, some rnb, alternative, indie, synthwave and movie soundtracks&#x28;yes they are
        amazing&#x29;.</p>
      <p>At present, my favorite rapper is Boogie. A crazy talented rapper from Compton whose lyrical genius is
        something to marvel at.</p>
      <img id="boogie" src="img/wsboogie.jpeg" alt="Westside Boogie">
      <p>Another thing I have come to love are movie soundtracks. Hans Zimmer has to be my favorite composer in that
        category. His work on the moviee Interstellar was sublime.</p>
      <p>My favorite movie soundtrack is Mountains by Hans Zimmer on Interstellar. The effects might not be the same
        without watching the movie scene but I believe it is beautiful nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Put your headpones on and enjoy.</p>

      <p>Also I recommend Interstellar if you have not watched it already. Great movie.</p>
