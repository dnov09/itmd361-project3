    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>My name is David Ngige. I am currently a 4th Year Computer Science student.</p>
    <h4 class="idx-h4">Ghanaian Background</h4>
    <p>I was born in Accra, the capital of Ghana.</p>
    <img class="idx-img" src="img/accra.jpg" alt="Accra">
    <p>The official language of Ghana is English. However, there are over a dozen different dialects/langauges spoken.
      My mother&#x27;s side of the family is from Akropong Akuapem, a town in the Easter Region. And since I was born and
      raised in
      Ghana, I speak Akuapem Twi &#x28;Ch-wee&#x29;.
    </p>
    <p>Akuapem Twi is simply one of the many dialects of the Akan language. Each region has their own version. Each
      with
      a rich history.</p>

    <h4 class="idx-h4">Nigerian Background</h4>
    <p>My Nigerian connection is thanks to my Father. Our family comes from the South-Eastern part of Nigeria.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I did not grow up around my Nigerian family so I speak little to no Igbo &#x28;e-bow&#x29;. Even
      with
      that, I am in contact with my family there and I love them everytime I visit.</p>

    <p>Also, favorite food is Waakye &#x28;Waa-ch-ey&#x29;, a Ghanaian dish.</p>
